# Write code for algorithm 1 below
 #1. Write a program that takes a positive number as an argument and prints the numbers from n to zero.

#Before we begin coding, we want to break down this problem and think about it recursively.

#We want to define a function that takes a number, let's say n , prints it, and calls itself again with the value of n-1. The function will keep calling itself until the base case is met. One way to do this is to determine if the number is equal to 0 and when it is, stop the function. Think about what the base case and recursive case would be.

def count_down(n):

  #  Base case
  if n==0:
      return

  #  Recursive case
  else:
      print(n)
      count_down(n-1)

# test case
n=8
count_down(n)

#OR

def count_down(n):
  #inherent base case
  #(will stop if n <= 0)
  if n>0:
      #recursive case
      print(n)
      count_down(n-1)
   
#test case
n=8
count_down(n)
