# Write code for algorithm 2 below
#2. Write a function that prints the natural numbers from 1 to n.

#We want to define a function that takes a number, let's say n , prints it, and calls itself again with the value of n-1. The function will keep calling itself until the base case is met. One way to do this is to determine if the number is equal to 0 and when it is, stop the function. Think about what the base case and recursive case would be.

def natural_numbers(lowerNum, higherNum):
    if lowerNum > higherNum:
        return
    else:
        print(lowerNum)
        natural_numbers(lowerNum + 1, higherNum)

n=10
natural_numbers(1,n)
